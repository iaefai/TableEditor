The Table Editor (work in progress) was born out of a need to integrate some form of data entry into a contract project for researchers. Presently, the tool works in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox with support for Internet Explorer 11 expected soon â€” absent due to differing implementation.

Future work will include merging and splitting table cells.

To use the table editor, clicking in a cell will select it, dragging from one cell to another will select multiple cells. When a single cell is selected, clicking again or typing will enter edit mode.
