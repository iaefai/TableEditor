The Table Editor (work in progress) was born out of a need to integrate some form of data entry into a contract project for researchers. 

The present version (table2.ts) is creating a class to manipulate tables, that will be connected to events after its completion.

The interactive demo is not online, but a Javascript manipulation is available at [my website](https://madebyjeffrey.com/edittable/TableEditor/demo.html).
